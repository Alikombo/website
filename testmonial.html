                        I learned in Paje with Hassan and Abu. Unfortunately no wind but they have big kites and I could learn from them. After 6 hours of lessons I was able to water start. They are very good teachers and I highly recommend these 2 guys if you want to learn. They speak a very good English, much better than mine lol

                        Hassan is amazing teacher and a really good friend. In a few hours I was already on the board kiting and since then its only getting better. He is reliable, always on time and knows what he is doing. I recommend him for a teacher!

                        Thanks to Hassan, i have found a new sport passion. He is a really good teacher, very patient and super encouraging. I am so grateful that he was my teacher, Iâ€™ve learnt so much and he cares towards his student progress.

                        Hassan is a great kite instructor, very patient and communicative! Great surfing and teaching skills as well! I really liked the time on the water with him:)  Learned a lot in short time starting from total basics!

                        Hassan is a really good instructor. He can see where you make mistakes and points it out so you can improve fast! With his help, I managed to do water-start very fast but before I was struggling! And he is also very patient and genuinely happy when he sees a student ride kite well. I would recommend his instructions to anybody who wants to learn kite fast and for a good price. P.s.: Paje and Zanzibar are amazing place to stay even when its not good wind to kite

                        Hassan and his team are excellent - very professional and attentive and very committed to getting you kitesurfing. Him and his team are lovely, relaxed and also very dedicated to supporting and improving the community around them through youth work and community projects, which you can support by supporting his school!
